# Rules
The rules of the Ã€kari puzzle game are as follows:

1. A board is a square of X by X cells.
2. Each cell on the board may contain one of the following:
	* A blank box (denoted by a "X")
	* A box with a label (denoted by a number)
	* A candle (denoted by a "C")
	* A black cell (not illuminated) - denoted by a "."
	* A white cell (illuminated by a candle) - denoted by a "*"
3. A candle illuminates cells horizontally and vertically until it reaches either a box or the limit of the board.
4. Two candles cannot illuminate each other.
5. When a label is noted on a box, it gives the number of candles adjacent (vertically or horizontally) to the box. A label can be 0, meaning
that there are no candles adjacent to this box, 1, 2, 3 or 4.
6. The goal is to place candles in non-box cells so that each cell is illuminated by a candle.

To win the game, you must place candles in all the non-box cells and ensure that each cell is illuminated by at least one candle. You cannot place candles 
on top of boxes or near other candles. Your goal is to solve the puzzle as quickly as possible while following the rules above.
